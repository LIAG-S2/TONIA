TONIA, sub-area differentiated-optimized nutrient management in arable farming

The aim of this joint project is not only to optimize nutrient management on arable land, but also for environmental reasons. Since soil is laterally variable and has different specifications, the entire farm areas are measured with a geoelectric measuring system called Geophilus Electricus. The responsibility of LIAG is to evaluate the geoelectric data in this project. The conductivity maps are then converted into 3D soil texture maps with the help of reference points' measurements.

Project description
Farms are not uniform in soil composition and moisture. Consequently, plants in a large area do not receive ideal fertilization. With a few amount of nutrients, plants will not achieve the possible yield on one hand. On the other hand, too many fertilizers contaminate the environment. The goal is a precise calculation of the demand for sub-surface areas. The TONIA project partners are developing soil sensors and 3D soil texture maps that explore the soil down to a depth of 150 cm, especially with regard to soil moisture. Combined with yield modelling, nutrient target value maps and maps of the usable field capacity are created with a resolution of 10x10m, on which the amount of fertilizer is converted according to sub-surface areas. Instead of distributing the total amount of nutrients evenly over the field, in future they will be applied as needed.

Responsibility of LIAG
The Geophilus Electricus measuring device (Lück & Rühlmann, 2013) measures continuously with five different penetration depths, by increasing the distances between the electrodes. The sensitivity distribution (Guillemoteau et al., 2017) shows how the measured values are composed of the background resistivities. The task of the LIAG is to reconstruct the conductivities from the measurement data. A robust software, tailored to the routine field application, is to be developed, which generates soil texture maps together with other sensors such as the gamma activity. These then serve as the basis for further management. 
The TONIA project brings together farmers, agronomists, soil scientists, geophysicists and software developers to tackle socially relevant problems in a practical way.
